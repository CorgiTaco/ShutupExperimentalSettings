# Shutup Experimental Settings!

This simple mod is a forge port of the fabric mod "Disable Custom Worlds Advice" which disables the annoying "Experimental Features" advice that appears every time you create or load a world with custom dimensions or world settings. You can use it if either this screen annoys you as much as it does to me or you are creating a mod with custom worldgen!(This README matches the README found at https://github.com/rdvdev2/DisableCustomWorldsAdvice/blob/master/README.MD)

Note: In 1.18.2, this mod also removes the warning symbol put there by Forge itself on any world using custom settings.
