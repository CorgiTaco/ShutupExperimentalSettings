# Shutup Experimental Settings

This simple mod is a forge port of the fabric mod "Disable Custom Worlds Advice" which disables the annoying "Experimental Features" advice that appears every time you create or load a world with custom dimensions or world settings. You can use it if either this screen annoys you as much as it does to me or you are creating a mod with custom worldgen!(This read me matches the README found at https://github.com/rdvdev2/DisableCustomWorldsAdvice/blob/master/README.MD
